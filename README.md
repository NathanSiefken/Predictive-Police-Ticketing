## Predictive Police Ticketing:  Using Machine Learning to Detect Patterns
*Note: The original data set parking-citations.csv was too large to upload but can be found on the Kaggle site https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations. I did upload a subset FTP, and you can see how I created set in my R script. FTP is the set I did my entire report on. 

The PDF is my report and the RMD file is the R Markdown that I created to generate the PDF. The script is all the code without much of the commentary. 
Please be sure to see the bonus section in the report that explains the interactive shiny dashboard that I built for this data.

I really enjoyed this classes! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to start my data science journey!!! After this project I really do feel confident in my abilities and I am excited about the future and learning more.
