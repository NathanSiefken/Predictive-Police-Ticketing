## Predictive Police Ticketing:  Using Machine Learning to Detect Patterns
*Note: The original data set parking-citations.csv was too large to upload to github but can be found on the Kaggle site https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations. 

The PDF is my report and the RMD file is the R Markdown I used to generate it. Please be sure to see interactive shiny dashboard that I built for with this data set.
You can go to the link below, if you are interested.
