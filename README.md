## Predictive Police Ticketing:  Using Machine Learning to Detect Patterns
*Note: The original data set parking-citations.csv was too large to upload but can be found on the Kaggle site https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations. I did upload a subset FTP, and you can see how I created set in my R script. 

The PDF is my report and the RMD file is the R Markdown that I created to generate the PDF. The script is all the code without much of the commentary. 
Please be sure to see the bonus section in the report that explains the interactive shiny dashboard that I built for this data.
